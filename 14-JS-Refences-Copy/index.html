      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice();

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      // console.log(team3);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      // console.log(team4);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
      console.log("~ Copy Array with Array.from ~");

      console.log(newTeam);

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      console.log("~ Copy Object with Object assign  ~");
      const cap = Object.assign({}, person);
      console.log(cap);

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      console.log("~ Copy Object with Spread  ~");
      const cap2 = { ...person };
      console.log(cap2);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
